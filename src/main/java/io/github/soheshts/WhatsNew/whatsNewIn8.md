#### Java Programming Language
* Lambda Expressions, a new language feature, has been introduced in this release. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.
* Method references provide easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.
* Default methods enable new functionality to be added to the interfaces of libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.
* Repeating Annotations provide the ability to apply the same annotation type more than once to the same declaration or type use.
* Type Annotations provide the ability to apply an annotation anywhere a type is used, not just on a declaration. Used with a pluggable type system, this feature enables improved type checking of your code.
* Improved type inference.
* Method parameter reflection.
#### Collections
* Classes in the new java.util.stream package provide a Stream API to support functional-style operations on streams of elements. The Stream API is integrated into the Collections API, which enables bulk operations on collections, such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations.
* Performance Improvement for HashMaps with Key Collisions
