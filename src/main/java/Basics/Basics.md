### Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that dictates a different algorithmic way to think about problems and program solutions for them. T contrast it with object-oriented programming, in OOP, the primary abstraction is Class/Object, whereas in functional programming the primary abstraction is a function. As in OOP, objects form the building blocks for computation. Similarly, in functional programming, functions form the building blocks for computation.
